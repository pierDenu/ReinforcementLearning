CartPole Simulation with Reinforcement Learning
This project simulates a CartPole system using reinforcement learning. It leverages Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pygame, and a custom Q-learning-based neural network to simulate and visualize the learning process of balancing a pole on a cart.
Overview
The CartPole Simulation project aims to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be used to balance a pole on a cart. The project consists of a simulated environment where the cart and pole interact, and a Q-learning neural network that learns to balance the pole by choosing appropriate actions.
